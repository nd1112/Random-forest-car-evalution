I use Random forest algo in this car evaluation case study because Random forest is a supervised learning algorithm. It has two variations â€“ one is used for classification problems and other is used for regression problems. It is one of the most flexible and easy to use algorithm.Random forest algorithm combines multiple decision-trees, resulting in a forest of trees, hence the name Random Forest. In the random forest classifier, the higher the number of trees in the forest results in higher accuracy.
